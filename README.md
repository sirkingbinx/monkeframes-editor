MonkeFrames is a keyframe-based camera animator loosely based on the Orion Drift spectator view that allows you to plan out camera movements with transitions for each property.

Create a keyframe by pressing V. It's properties will show up on the MonkeFrames panel in the top right. You can tweak its transitions, position, and rotation, or replace the currently selected keyframe by pressing X.

## Installation
### MonkeModManager
You can install MonkeFrames with [MonkeModManager](https://git.sirkingbinx.dev/sirkingbinx/MonkeModManager/-/releases).
1. Search for "MonkeFrames" on the Search bar
2. Check the box next to "MonkeFrames"
3. Press "Install / Update"

### Manual
1. Download `MonkeFrames.zip` from the [releases](https://git.sirkingbinx.dev/monkeframes/editor/-/releases) page
2. Extract the zip file into `BepInEx/plugins/` (BepInEx) or `Mods` (MelonLoader)

## Usage
Press `V` to create a new keyframe. You can press `T` to create a new keyframe looking at the monke, `X` to replace the current keyframe with a new one, or click `Keyframe` > `Delete Keyframe` on the topbar to delete the selected keyframe.

Once a keyframe is created, you can see it's values with the Keyframe Editor. Press `View` > `Keyframe Editor` to view and select every keyframe in your project.
